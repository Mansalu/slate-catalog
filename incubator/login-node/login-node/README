Check that the deployment has been been created, and the pod is running by using kubectl describe deployment deployment_name,
and kubectl describe pod [pod_name]. 

#Adding users 
To add users, modify the values.yaml file. Currently there are dummy values in the config file data, make sure to replace these before ssh'ing. 
The format for adding a user is [user_name]:[password]:[user_id]:[group_id]::[/bin/bash]:[user_public_key]. Make sure to leave an empty line 
after each user you add. 

# SSH
To find the IP address of the node that the pod is running on, use kubectl describe nodes, and look for the pod.
The IP address of the node should be in InternalIP under addresses, right above where the pods are listed. To 
find the port use kubectl describe service [service_name]. Then, you can ssh in using 
ssh -i [user_private_key] -p [port_no] [user_name]@[IP]
